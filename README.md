# timeshifting-gradle
This Project has an Aspect class that has aspect to shift the time we need it.
All you need to do is, set the time offset into the static fields in TimeOffsetReader. 
When ever this aspect is applied on your code base, and setting the offset into the static field will give you the date what you set.
This gives a flexibility of moving your current time to forward or backward.
